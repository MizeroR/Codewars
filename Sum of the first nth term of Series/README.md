You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.

Rules

You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples (Input --> Output)

n
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"
